General Information
===================

gstreamermm provides C++ bindings for the GStreamer streaming multimedia
library (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org).  With gstreamermm it is possible to
develop applications that work with multimedia in C++.

gstreamermm is developed over glibmm, libsigc++ and libxml++ and the
functionalities they provide.  This means that, among other things, referencing
and unreferencing of GObjects is handled automatically via glibmm's automatic
pointer class, Glib:RefPtr<>, and libsigc++'s slots are used for callbacks and
signals.

There are several examples, including a media player, in the examples/
directory, that demonstrate how to use the API and there are API docs in the
docs/reference/html directory.  The core plug-ins, such as Gst::Identity and
Gst::FileSrc are also provide along with many of the base plug-ins.

gstreamermm requires glibmm >= 2.16.0, giomm >= 2.16.0, and libxml++ >= 2.14.0
along with the libraries that these require.  For the examples, gtkmm >= 2.12
is also required.
