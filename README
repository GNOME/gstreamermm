General Information
===================

gstreamermm provides C++ bindings for the GStreamer streaming multimedia
library (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org).  With gstreamermm it is possible to
develop applications that work with multimedia in C++.

gstreamermm is developed over glibmm, libsigc++ and libxml++ and the
functionalities they provide.  This means that, among other things, referencing
and unreferencing of GObjects is handled automatically via glibmm's automatic
pointer class, Glib::RefPtr, and libsigc++'s slots are used for callbacks and
signals.

There are several examples, including a media player, in the examples/
directory, that demonstrate how to use the API.  Devhelp and html
documentation is also provided and the API documentation is also found on
library.gnome.org.  The core plug-ins, such as Gst::Identity and Gst::FileSrc
are also provided along with many of the base plug-ins.

Dependencies
============

gstreamermm requires glibmm >= 2.47.6 along with the libraries that these
require. For the examples, gtkmm >= 3.0 is also required.

Build Dependencies
==================

To build gstreamermm from git (not from tarballs), many gstreamer plug-ins must
be available. If you also built gstreamer and gst-plugins-good from source then
you must have the correct libraries installed when building them.

For instance on debian/Ubuntu, apt-get install:
libvorbis-dev libtheora-dev libasound-dev libxv-dev libvisual-0.4-dev libcdparanoia-dev
