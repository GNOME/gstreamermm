General Information
===================

gstreamermm-plugins-good provides C++ bindings for the GStreamer good plug-ins.
It relies on gstreamermm for some of the base classes that the good plug-ins
derive from, and it provides C++ bindings for the GStreamer good plugins.

gstreamermm-plugins-good is developed over glibmm, libsigc++ and libxml++ and the functionalities they provide.  This means that, among other things, referencing and unreferencing of GObjects is handled automatically via glibmm's automatic
pointer class, Glib:RefPtr<>, and libsigc++'s slots are used for callbacks and
signals.  gstreamermm includes examples of how to use the API.

gstreamermm-plugins-good requires gstreamermm along with the libraries that it
requires and that the GStreamer good plug-ins be installed.
