	* tools/extra_defs_gen/generate_defs_gst.cc:
	* gstreamer-plugins-good/src/gst_signals.defs: Included existing good
	plug-ins in list of defs generation and regenerated the signal and
	property defs.

	* gstreamer-plugins-good/src/generate-enums.sh:
	* gstreamer-plugins-good/src/gst_enums.defs.patch:
	* gstreamer-plugins-good/src/gst_enums.defs: Added an enum generation
	script and a patch to fix original generation for good plug-ins.
	Generated enum defs.  Some plug-ins (like audioamplify) don't define
	their enums in .h file with the enum name so those enum definitons
	will probably have to be handwritten.

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am: Removed unexisting file,
	reference-index.txt, from dist.

	* README: Formatted last paragraph.  gstreamermm-plugins-good has also
	been added to jhbuild.  It doesn't seem to be reflected yet because
	jhbuild does not yet find the module here.  Hopefully it will.  I hope
	it's okay that I added it to jhbuid.

2009-03-30  José Alburquerque  <jaalburqu@svn.gnome.org>

	* gstreamer-plugins-good/gstreamermm-plugins-good.h: Don't include
	wrap_init.h in all the includes because users are not likely to use
	wrap_init().
	* gstreamer-plugins-good/gstreamermm-plugins-good/init.cc: Typo.
