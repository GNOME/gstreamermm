	* README: Formatted last paragraph.  gstreamermm-plugins-good has also
	been added to jhbuild.  It doesn't seem to be reflected yet because
	jhbuild does not yet find the module here.  Hopefully it will.  I hope
	it's okay that I added it to jhbuid.

	* gstreamer-plugins-good/gstreamermm-plugins-good.h: Don't include
	wrap_init.h in all the includes because users are not likely to use
	wrap_init().
	* gstreamer-plugins-good/gstreamermm-plugins-good/init.cc: Typo.
