/** Gst::Object â€” Base class for the GStreamer object hierarchy.
 * Gst::Object provides a root for the object hierarchy tree filed in by the
 * GStreamer library. It is currently a thin wrapper on top of Glib::Object.
 * It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own.
 *
 * Gst::Object gives us basic refcounting, parenting functionality and
 * locking. Most of the function are just extended for special GStreamer needs
 * and can be found under the same name in the base class of Gst::Object which
 * is Glib::Object (e.g. Glib::Object::reference() becomes
 * Gst:Object::reference().
 *
 * In contrast to Glib::Object instances, Gst::Object adds a name property.
 * The functions set_name() and get_name() are used to set/get the name of the
 * object.
