/** A grouped scatter data buffer type for data-passing.
 * Buffer lists are units of grouped scatter/gather data transfer in GStreamer.
 *
 * Buffer lists are created with create() and filled with data using a
 * Gst::BufferListIterator. The iterator has no current buffer; its cursor
 * position lies between buffers, immediately before the buffer that would be
 * returned by Gst::BufferListIterator::next(). After iterating to the end of a group the iterator must
 * be advanced to the next group by a call to
 * Gst::BufferListIterator::next_group() before any further calls to
 * Gst::BufferListIterator::next() can return buffers again. The cursor
 * position of a newly created iterator lies before the first group; a call to
 * Gst::BufferListIterator::next_group() is necessary before calls to
 * Gst::BufferListIterator::next() can return buffers.
 *
 * For more details, see the C API docs.
