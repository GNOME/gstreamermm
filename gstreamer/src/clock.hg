/** Gst::Clock - Abstract class for global clocks.
 * GStreamer uses a global clock to synchronize the plugins in a pipeline.
 * Different clock implementations are possible by implementing this abstract
 * base class.
 *
 * The Gst::Clock returns a monotonically increasing time with the method
 * get_time(). Its accuracy and base time depend on the specific clock
 * implementation but time is always expressed in nanoseconds. Since the
 * baseline of the clock is undefined, the clock time returned is not
 * meaningful in itself, what matters are the deltas between two clock times.
 * The time returned by a clock is called the absolute time.
 *
 * The pipeline uses the clock to calculate the stream time. Usually all
 * renderers synchronize to the global clock using the buffer timestamps, the
 * newsegment events and the element's base time, see Gst::Pipeline.
 *
 * A clock implementation can support periodic and single shot clock
 * notifications both synchronous and asynchronous.
 *
 * One first needs to create a Gst::ClockID for the periodic or single shot
 * notification using create_single_shot_id() or create_periodic_id().
 *
 * To perform a blocking wait for the specific time of the Gst::ClockID use the
 * Gst::ClockID::wait() method. To receive a callback when the specific time is
 * reached in the clock use Gst::ClockID::wait_async(). Both these calls can be
 * interrupted with the Gst::ClockID::unschedule() call. If the blocking wait
 * is unscheduled a return value of Gst::CLOCK_UNSCHEDULED is returned.
 *
 * Periodic callbacks scheduled async will be repeadedly called automatically
 * until it is unscheduled. To schedule a sync periodic callback,
 * Gst::ClockID::wait() should be called repeadedly.
 *
 * The async callbacks can happen from any thread, either provided by the core
 * or from a streaming thread. The application should be prepared for this.
 *
 * A Gst::ClockID that has been unscheduled cannot be used again for any wait
 * operation, a new Gst::ClockID should be created.
 *
 * It is possible to perform a blocking wait on the same ClockID from multiple
 * threads. However, registering the same ClockID for multiple async
 * notifications is not possible, the slot will only be called for the thread
 * registering the entry last.
 *
 * None of the wait operations unref the Gst::ClockID, the owner is responsible
 * for unreffing the ids itself. This holds for both periodic and single shot
 * notifications. The reason being that the owner of the Gst::ClockID has to
 * keep a handle to the Gst::ClockID to unblock the wait on FLUSHING events or
 * state changes and if the entry would be unreffed automatically, the handle
 * might become invalid without any notification. (The RefPtr takes care of
 * unreffing in this case)
 *
 * These clock operations do not operate on the stream time, so the callbacks
 * will also occur when not in PLAYING state as if the clock just keeps on
 * running. Some clocks however do not progress when the element that provided
 * the clock is not PLAYING.
 *
 * When a clock has the Gst::CLOCK_FLAG_CAN_SET_MASTER flag set, it can be
 * slaved to another Gst::Clock with the set_master() method. The clock will
 * then automatically be synchronized to this master clock by repeadedly
 * sampling the master clock and the slave clock and recalibrating the slave
 * clock with set_calibration(). This feature is mostly useful for plugins that
 * have an internal clock but must operate with another clock selected by the
 * Gst::Pipeline.  They can track the offset and rate difference of their
 * internal clock relative to the master clock by using the get_calibration()
 * method.
 *
 * The master/slave synchronisation can be tuned with the "timeout",
 * "window-size" and "window-threshold" properties. The "timeout" property
 * defines the interval to sample the master clock and run the calibration
 * functions. "window-size" defines the number of samples to use when
 * calibrating and "window-threshold" defines the minimum number of samples
 * before the calibration is performed.
