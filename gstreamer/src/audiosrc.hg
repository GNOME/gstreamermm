/** A simple base class for audio sources.
 * This is the most simple base class for audio sources that only requires
 * subclasses to implement a set of simple virtual functions:
 *
 * - open_vfunc() - Open the device.
 * - prepare_vfunc()  - Configure the device with the specified format.
 * - read_vfunc() - Read samples from the device.
 * - reset_vfunc() - Unblock reads and flush the device.
 * - get_delay_vfunc() - Get the number of samples written but not yet played
 * by the device.
 * - unprepare_vfunc() - Undo operations done by prepare.
 * - close_vfunc() - Close the device.
 *
 * All scheduling of samples and timestamps is done in this base class together
 * with Gst::AudioBaseSrc using a default implementation of a
 * Gst::AudioRingBuffer that uses threads.
