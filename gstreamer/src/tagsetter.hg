/** Gst::TagSetter â€” Gst::Element interface that allows setting and retrieval
 * of media metadata.
 *
 * Elements that support changing a stream's metadata will implement this
 * interface. Examples of such elements are 'vorbisenc', 'theoraenc' and
 * 'id3v2mux'.
 *
 * If you just want to retrieve metadata in your application then all you need
 * to do is watch for tag messages on your pipeline's bus. This interface is
 * only for setting metadata, not for extracting it. To set tags from the
 * application, find tagsetter elements and set tags using e.g. merge_tags() or
 * add_tags(). The application should do that before the element goes to
 * Gst::STATE_PAUSED.
 *
 * Elements implementing the Gst::TagSetter interface often have to merge any
 * tags received from upstream and the tags set by the application via the
 * interface. This can be done like this:
 *
 * TODO: Add code example from C API docs
