/** ChildProxy â€” Interface for multi child elements.
 * This interface abstracts handling of property sets for child elements.
 * Imagine elements such as mixers or polyphonic generators. They all have
 * multiple Pad or some kind of voice objects. The element acts as a parent
 * for those child objects. Each child has the same properties.
 *
 * By implementing this interface the child properties can be accessed from
 * the parent element by using child_proxy_get() and child_proxy_set().
 *
 * Property names are written as "child-name::property-name". The whole naming
 * scheme is recursive. Thus "child1::child2::property" is valid too, if
 * "child1" also implements the ChildProxy interface.
